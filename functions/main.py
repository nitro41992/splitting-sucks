                            Instructions:
                            - First, accurately transcribe every item and its listed price exactly as shown on the receipt, before performing any calculations or transformations. Do not assume or infer numbers â€” copy the listed amount first. Only after verifying transcription, adjust for quantities.
                            - Sometimes, items may have add-ons or modifiers in the receipt.
                            - Use your intuition to roll up the add-ons into the parent item and sum the prices.
                            - If an item or line has its own price listed to the far right of it, it must be treated as a separate line item in the JSON, even if it appears visually indented, grouped, or described as part of a larger item. Do not assume bundling unless there is no separate price.
                            - MAKE SURE the price is the individual price for the item and the quantity is accurate based on the receipt. (ex. If the receipt says Quantity of 2 and price is $10, then the price of the item to provide is $5, not $10)
                            - MAKE SURE all items, quantities, and prices are present and accurate in the json'''
