**Instructions:**
- Sometimes, items may have add-ons or modifiers in the receipt. 
    - Use your intution to roll up the add-ons into the parent item and sum the prices.
- MAKE SURE the price is the individiual price for the item and the quantity is accurate based on the receipt. (ex. If the receipt says Quantity of 2 and price is $10, then the price of the item to provide is $5, not $10)
- MAKE SURE all items, quantities, and prices are present and accurate in the json

You should return a JSON object that contains the following keys:
- items: A list of dictionaries representing individual items. Each dictionary should have the following keys:
    - item: The name of the item.
    - quantity: The quantity of the item.
    - price: The price of one unit of the item.
- subtotal: The subtotal amount.

Instructions:
- First, accurately transcribe every item and its listed price exactly as shown on the receipt, before performing any calculations or transformations. Do not assume or infer numbers â€” copy the listed amount first. Only after verifying transcription, adjust for quantities.
- Sometimes, items may have add-ons or modifiers in the receipt.
- Use your intuition to roll up the add-ons into the parent item and sum the prices.
- If an item or line has its own price listed to the far right of it, it must be treated as a separate line item in the JSON, even if it appears visually indented, grouped, or described as part of a larger item. Do not assume bundling unless there is no separate price.
- MAKE SURE the price is the individual price for the item and the quantity is accurate based on the receipt. (ex. If the receipt says Quantity of 2 and price is $10, then the price of the item to provide is $5, not $10)
- MAKE SURE all items, quantities, and prices are present and accurate in the json''',

Analyze the voice transcription and receipt items to determine who ordered what.
Each item in the receipt items list has a numeric 'id'. Use these IDs to refer to items when possible, especially if the transcription mentions numbers.

Pay close attention to:
1. Include ALL people mentioned in the transcription
2. Make sure all items are assigned to someone, marked as shared, or added to the unassigned_items array. Its important to include all items.
3. Ensure quantities and prices match the receipt, providing a positive integer for quantity.
4. If not every instance of an item is mentioned in the transcription, make sure to add the item to the unassigned_items array
5. If numeric references to items are provided, use the provided numeric IDs to reference items when the transcription includes numbers that seem to correspond to items.''',
