# Implementation Plan for App Navigation Redesign

> **Note:** This document tracks the implementation status of the app navigation redesign defined in `docs/app_navigation_redesign.md`

## Current Implementation Status

**Completed:**
- Firestore emulator seeded with configuration data using Python script
- Firebase emulator configuration in `firebase.json` with port conflicts resolved
- Updated Pydantic models for `assign_people_to_items` Cloud Function
- Created `FirestoreService` with emulator support and CRUD operations
- Implemented `Receipt` model with Firestore serialization/deserialization
- Implemented main navigation with bottom tabs (Receipts and Settings)
- Created Receipts screen with filters, search, and FAB
- Implemented restaurant name input dialog to start the workflow
- Created modal workflow controller with 5-step progress indicator
- Implemented automatic draft saving when exiting the workflow
- Integrated upload, review, voice assignment, and split screens
- Implemented proper data flow between steps with state management
- Connected final summary screen to modal workflow
- Fixed parameter type issues in workflow screens
- Implemented thumbnail generation placeholder
- Implemented proper thumbnail generation via Cloud Function
- Completed draft resume/edit functionality
- Implemented delete functionality with confirmation dialog
- Fixed component parameter mismatches in the workflow modal

**In Progress:**
- None

**Pending:**
- Create testing suite for all components
- Optimize performance for image loading and caching

## Technical Implementation Details

### Screen Component Status

1. **Main Navigation:**
   - ✅ Bottom navigation bar with tabs
   - ✅ Tab-based routing to main screens

2. **Receipts Screen:**
   - ✅ Filter tabs for All/Completed/Drafts
   - ✅ Search functionality with filtering
   - ✅ Receipt cards with thumbnails
   - ✅ FAB to create new receipts
   - ✅ Resume functionality with proper parameter passing
   - ✅ Delete functionality with confirmation dialog

3. **Workflow Modal:**
   - ✅ Full-page modal implementation
   - ✅ Step indicator with navigation
   - ✅ Navigation buttons with proper state management
   - ✅ Automatic draft saving
   - ✅ Parameter types between steps fixed
   - ✅ Component interface consistency ensured

4. **Individual Steps:**
   - ✅ Upload: Camera/gallery picker implemented
   - ✅ Review: Item editing functionality working
   - ✅ Assign: Voice transcription and assignment working
   - ✅ Split: Item sharing and reassignment implemented
   - ✅ Summary: Tax/tip calculations implemented and properly connected

### Current Challenges

1. **Data Persistence:**
   - ✅ Draft saving and resuming functionality working
   - ✅ Deletion with confirmation dialog implemented
   - ⚠️ Need to handle edge cases when modifying completed receipts

2. **Image Processing:**
   - ✅ Image upload to Firebase Storage working
   - ✅ Proper thumbnail generation via cloud function implemented

3. **Data Flow:**
   - ✅ WorkflowState maintains data between steps
   - ✅ SplitManager properly handles tax/tip values
   - ✅ Tax and tip values properly propagate between split view and summary
   - ✅ Component interfaces aligned for consistent data passing

## Environment Setup Status

### Emulator Configuration

1. **Setup Working:**
   - `.env` file with `USE_FIRESTORE_EMULATOR=true` toggles emulator use
   - FirestoreService detects environment and connects appropriately
   - Seeding script creates test data in emulator

2. **Ports Configured:**
   - Firestore on port 8081
   - Storage on port 9199
   - Emulator UI on port 4000

## Testing Status

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Basic service unit tests implemented
   - Need comprehensive testing for FirestoreService
   - Need Receipt model serialization/deserialization tests

2. **Widget Tests:**
   - Basic widget tests for common components
   - Need workflow modal navigation tests
   - Need to test screen transitions and state preservation

3. **Integration Tests:**
   - Not yet implemented
   - Need full end-to-end workflow testing
   - Need to test with emulator integration

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Create Comprehensive Testing Suite:**
   - Unit tests for all services and models
   - Widget tests for all UI components
   - Integration tests for full workflow

2. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Implement image caching for better performance
   - Add pagination for receipts list
   - Optimize state management to reduce rebuilds 

3. **Handle Edge Cases:**
   - Test and handle completed receipt modifications
   - Improve error handling and recovery
