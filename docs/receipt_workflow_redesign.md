   - Enhanced expand/collapse interaction with visual indicators

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Draft Navigation State
**Issue:** When saving a draft at step 2 and returning, the app navigated back to step 0 instead of step 1.

**Solution:** Modified the step determination logic in `_loadReceiptData` method to correctly set the target step based on available data:
```dart
// Determine target step
int targetStep = 0; // Default to Upload (Step 0)
if (workflowState.hasAssignmentData) {
  targetStep = 2; // Go to Summary (Step 2) if assignment data exists
} else if (workflowState.hasTranscriptionData) {
  targetStep = 1; // Go to Assign (Step 1) if transcription data exists
} else if (workflowState.hasParseData) {
  targetStep = 1; // Go to Assign (Step 1) if parse data exists, not step 0
}
```

### 2. Step Navigation Limitations
**Issue:** Users couldn't swipe back and forth between steps that already had data.

**Solution:** 
1. Implemented clickable step indicators with the `WorkflowStepIndicator` widget:
   - Added `onStepTapped` callback to handle navigation
   - Added `availableSteps` property to track which steps are available for navigation

2. Added swipe gesture support in `workflow_modal.dart`:
   - Implemented `_handleSwipe` method to detect swipe direction and velocity
   - Added different navigation rules for forward vs. backward navigation
   - Applied velocity threshold to prevent accidental swipes
   - Allowed unrestricted navigation to previous steps
   - Maintained proper flow restrictions for advancing forward

3. Implemented proper feedback with toast messages when attempting invalid navigation

### 3. Upload Race Condition
**Issue:** Multiple simultaneous uploads were triggered causing an infinite loop.

**Solution:**
- Added `_isUploading` state tracking to prevent duplicate uploads
- Modified auto-progression logic to check loading states
- Implemented proper upload state management across components

### 4. Item Dialog Rendering and Validation
**Issue:** Edit Item dialog was missing Material widget parent, causing TextField rendering errors. Both Add and Edit item dialogs lacked proper price input validation and formatting.

**Solution:**
1. Fixed rendering issue in Edit Item dialog:
   - Added Material widget as a parent to the Container
   - Ensured consistent widget hierarchy between Add and Edit dialogs

2. Enhanced price field in both dialogs:
   ```dart
   // Added input formatters to ensure only valid numeric input
   inputFormatters: [
     // Allow only numbers and decimal point
     FilteringTextInputFormatter.allow(RegExp(r'[0-9.]')),
     // Custom formatter to handle decimal formatting
     TextInputFormatter.withFunction((oldValue, newValue) {
       final formattedValue = _formatPrice(newValue.text);
       return TextEditingValue(
         text: formattedValue,
         selection: TextSelection.collapsed(offset: formattedValue.length),
       );
     }),
   ],
   ```

3. Implemented real-time validation with clear error messages:
   ```dart
   void _validatePrice(String value) {
     setState(() {
       if (value.isEmpty) {
         _priceError = 'Price is required';
       } else {
         final price = double.tryParse(value);
         if (price == null) {
           _priceError = 'Invalid price format';
         } else if (price <= 0) {
           _priceError = 'Price must be greater than 0';
         } else {
           _priceError = null;
         }
       }
     });
   }
   ```

4. Added visual error feedback to match design language:
   - Error text displayed in red below the price field
   - Consistent styling with the app's color scheme
   - Improved user experience with immediate validation feedback

### 5. Bill Summary Screen Visual Inconsistency
**Issue:** The Bill Summary screen lacked the distinct neumorphic card separation and streamlined information flow seen in other screens.

**Solution:**
1. Consolidated the 'Split Summary' heading:
   - Created one primary section title at the top with document icon and 'Edit Split' button
   - Removed the secondary "Split Summary (X People)" title that appeared lower down
   - Improved visual clarity and reduced redundancy

2. Redesigned the 'Receipt Totals' presentation:
   - Created a distinct neumorphic card with proper shadow effects
   - Improved the tax input field with inset shadow styling
   - Enhanced tip selection with neumorphic buttons and slider
   - Ensured proper sizing to flow better with per-person summaries

3. Enhanced Per-Person Summary Cards:
   - Applied consistent neumorphic styling with proper shadows
   - Added neumorphic styling to avatars and amount tags
   - Improved typography for better readability
   - Maintained clear information hierarchy within each card

4. Repositioned Action Buttons:
   - Placed 'Support Me' and 'Share Bill' buttons clearly below all content
   - Added adequate spacing to prevent visual overlap
   - Centered the buttons for better visual balance
   - Enhanced the neumorphic effect for better affordance

## Current Issues

### 1. Performance Degradation
**Issue:** Processing a receipt still takes longer and shows a spinner with "Processing Receipt..." longer than before.

**Current Status:** Partially addressed with improved loading state management, but still needs optimization.

**Remaining Work:**
- Further optimize the `_uploadImageAndProcess` method to reduce duplication
- Implement more targeted loading indicators that only affect the relevant parts of the UI
- Consider adding progress indicators for sub-steps of processing

### 2. Thumbnail-to-Image Transition Delay
**Issue:** There is a significant delay when transitioning from thumbnail to full image, particularly when navigating back from the summary page of an existing receipt.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- The app may be refetching images from Firebase Storage unnecessarily
- The caching mechanism may not be properly retaining loaded images 
- Image state may be reset during navigation between steps

**Potential Fix:**
- Implement better image caching to prevent repeated downloads
- Preserve image data during step navigation
- Optimize how image references are stored and retrieved
- Consider adding placeholder animations during the transition

### 3. Exit Dialog Cancel Behavior
**Issue:** When a user attempts to exit the workflow (via back gesture or X button), a dialog appears asking if they want to save changes. If the user clicks "Cancel" (indicating they want to remain in the workflow), the app incorrectly exits to the receipts screen anyway.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- The dialog's "Cancel" response handling logic is not properly implemented
- The return value from the confirmation dialog may not be correctly propagated to the caller
- The WillPopScope or equivalent navigation guard may not be correctly respecting the dialog result

**Potential Fix:**
- Review and correct the `_onWillPop` method in `workflow_modal.dart`
- Ensure confirmation dialog results are properly handled
- Add additional logging to track the navigation flow
- Consider adding a dedicated test for this specific navigation path

## Next Steps

### Immediate Fixes (High Priority)
1. **Further Address Performance Issues:**
   - Optimize Firebase operations by implementing caching strategies
   - Add more granular progress indicators for each sub-step of processing
   - Implement request debouncing to prevent duplicate server calls

2. **Visual Feedback Improvements:**
   - Add transition animations between steps
   - Improve loading indicators with progress percentages
   - Add haptic feedback for successful navigation events

3. **Refine Navigation Experience:**
   - Implement smoother transitions between steps 
   - Enhance visual feedback when swiping and tapping navigation elements
   - Consider adding a tutorial overlay for first-time users

4. **Further Item Dialog Enhancements:**
   - Consider adding currency symbol selection for international support
   - Add support for tax-inclusive item pricing
   - Implement item categorization for better organization

### Future Enhancements (Medium Priority)
1. **Error Handling:**
   - Enhance error messages for upload/processing failures
   - Add retry options with clearer user guidance
   - Implement offline data persistence for interrupted workflows

2. **State Management Refactoring:**

### Design Implementation Notes

#### Neumorphic Design System
The app implements a "Neumorphism-Lite" design system across its interface, characterized by:

1. **Light Background with Subtle Shadows**: Uses a very light grey background (#F5F5F7) with white/near-white cards
2. **Soft Shadow Effects**: Elements appear gently raised with diffused outer shadows (no hard edges)
3. **Color Palette**:
   - Primary: Slate Blue (#506C97) - Used for primary actions, highlights, and totals
   - Secondary: Muted Coral/Peach (#C6878F) - Used for secondary actions and section titles
   - Tertiary: Rosy Brown (#B79D94) - Used for tertiary elements like shared items

4. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Elevated buttons use raised shadows to indicate clickability
   - Input fields use subtle inset shadows to indicate editable areas
   - Cards use gentle shadows to create visual separation

5. **Typography**:
   - Clear hierarchy with font weight and size distinctions
   - Dark grey text on light backgrounds for maximum readability
   - Accent colors used sparingly for section headers and important values

#### Bill Summary Screen Implementation
The redesigned Bill Summary screen features:

1. **Consolidated Header**: A single "Split Summary" header with edit button, removing redundant titles
2. **Receipt Totals Card**: Compact, clear presentation of subtotal, tax, and tip with interactive controls
3. **Individual Person Cards**: Each person has their own distinct card with expandable details
4. **Slate Blue Amount Tags**: Amount totals are displayed in eye-catching slate blue pills
5. **Bottom-Centered Action Buttons**: "Support Me" and "Share Bill" buttons are placed at the bottom center
6. **Visual Flow**: Clear progression from overall totals to individual breakdowns
7. **Consistent Padding**: Maintains comfortable spacing between all elements
8. **Expanded States**: Person cards have clear collapsed/expanded states with proper visuals

This system creates a cohesive, visually pleasing interface that guides users through the receipt splitting process with minimal cognitive load.

### Navigation Pattern

We've implemented a hybrid navigation approach that combines:

1. **Clickable Step Indicators**: Users can tap directly on step indicators to jump to available steps:
   - Available steps are determined based on workflow state
   - Visual feedback shows which steps are available
   - Toast messages explain why unavailable steps can't be accessed

2. **Swipe Gestures**: Users can swipe horizontally to navigate:
   - Swiping right (positive dx velocity) navigates to the previous step
   - Swiping left (negative dx velocity) navigates to the next step
   - A velocity threshold prevents accidental swipes
   - Different rules apply to forward vs. backward navigation
   - Users can always swipe back to previously completed steps
   - Forward navigation requires completion of prerequisite steps

3. **Contextual Buttons**: The top app bar provides context-specific actions:
   - "X" button to close the workflow
   - "Save Bill" button on final step

This approach provides multiple intuitive ways for users to navigate while maintaining the proper workflow progression.

### Race Condition Fix

We identified and fixed a race condition in the upload flow where:
1. Image selection would trigger a background upload
2. The UI would auto-progress to parsing
3. Parsing would detect no URI and start a second upload
4. This created an infinite loop of upload attempts

The fix implemented:
- Added state tracking with `_isUploading` flag
- Added checks in auto-progression to prevent duplicate processing
- Made upload state transparent between components

This pattern should be followed for any future modifications to ensure operations like uploads aren't unintentionally duplicated.

### Price Input Formatting and Validation

We've implemented a consistent approach to price input formatting and validation that:

1. **Enforces Valid Numeric Input**: Only allows numbers and a single decimal point
   - Uses `FilteringTextInputFormatter.allow(RegExp(r'[0-9.]'))` to restrict input
   - Custom formatter handles decimal placement and ensures max 2 decimal places

2. **Provides Real-time Validation**: Validates as the user types
   - Shows clear, specific error messages for different error cases
   - Visually indicates error state directly in the UI

3. **Maintains UX Consistency**: Uses the same validation approach across all money input fields
   - Should be extended to other monetary input fields in the app
   - Creates a predictable pattern for users

This implementation follows the app's design principles by prioritizing visual clarity, providing immediate feedback, and maintaining a clean, modern aesthetic while ensuring data integrity.
