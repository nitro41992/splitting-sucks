# Billfie App Test Coverage: Product Guide

## What's This Document?
This guide explains which parts of the Billfie app have automated tests and which parts still need them. Think of tests as safety nets that catch bugs before they reach users.

## Why Testing Matters for Our Current Projects
We're planning two big changes:
1. **UI Redesign**: Making the app look better and more user-friendly
2. **Local Caching**: Allowing the app to work offline and sync later

Without proper tests, these changes could break existing features. Tests help us change the app confidently.

## Test Coverage Status at a Glance

| Feature Area | Coverage | UI Redesign Risk | Offline Caching Risk |
|--------------|----------|------------------|----------------------|
| Receipt CRUD Operations | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟡 Medium |
| Image Upload & Display | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟡 Medium |
| Receipt Review & Item Editing | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low |
| Navigation Between Steps | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low |
| **People Assignment Screen** | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟡 Medium |
| **Bill Splitting Calculations** | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low |
| **Split Step Screen** | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low |
| Cloud Functions | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low |
| Image Storage & Retrieval | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟡 Medium |
| Confirmation Dialogs | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Medium | 🟡 Medium |

**Legend:**
- 🟢 Good shape - low risk
- 🟡 Some concerns - medium risk
- 🔴 Needs attention - high risk

## Current Test Status (Product View)

### ✅ Already Well-Tested

**Basic App Functions**
- Creating, updating, and deleting receipts in the database
- Uploading receipt images 
- Reviewing and editing receipt items
- Moving between workflow steps (navigation)
- Bill splitting calculations (including tax and tip distribution)
- People assignment screen (fixed and now well-tested)
- Split screen calculations and functionality

**Backend Operations**
- All cloud functions (image processing, receipt parsing, etc.)
- Data models and how they're stored
- Firebase Storage operations (image uploading and deletion)

### ⚠️ Areas for Additional Tests

**Summary Screen Tests**
- Need to implement tests for the final screen showing the split summary
- Verify total calculations and displays are accurate

**Dialog Widget Tests**  
- Need to complete tests for remaining dialog components
- Verify proper rendering and interaction behavior

### ⏳ Test Implementation Progress

**1. People Assignment Screen** ✅ COMPLETED
- Tests have been written and fixed
- Proper mocking for Firebase dependencies implemented
- All tests are now passing

**2. Bill Splitting Screen** ✅ COMPLETED
- Tests now verify:
  - Tip and tax are calculated and distributed correctly
  - Final split amounts are determined accurately
  - Complex scenarios with shared items work properly
  - Edge cases like removing people after assignments are handled correctly
- All tests are now passing

**3. Summary Screen Tests** (NEW PRIORITY)
- Need to implement tests for the final screen showing the split summary
- Verify total calculations and displays are accurate

**4. Image Handling in Offline Mode** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Tests for image operations have been improved and are now passing 
- Additional tests needed for offline-specific behavior

**5. Confirmation Dialogs and Error Handling** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Testing what happens when users confirm or cancel important actions
- How errors are displayed to users

## What This Means for Product Timeline

**UI Redesign Is Ready to Proceed:**
- ✅ Tests for the Bill Splitting logic are complete and passing
- ✅ Tests for the People Assignment Screen are fixed and passing
- ✅ Split Screen tests are complete and passing
- ✅ All 288 tests in the test suite are now passing
- Our core calculation logic is well-tested, making the redesign less risky
- We can proceed with the UI redesign with full confidence in the core functionality

**Before Offline Caching Can Launch:**
- ✅ All core test functionality is in place and passing
- Need to add specific tests for offline behavior
- Should test what happens when network connection is lost during use

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Complete Firebase Testing Improvements ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Implemented a simplified testing approach for Firebase dependencies
2. ✅ Made AssignStepWidget tests fully operational
3. ✅ Applied the same approach to SplitStepWidget tests

### Phase 2: Assignment Screen Tests ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Tests have been written and fixed
- ✅ Firebase initialization issues resolved
- ✅ Return type mismatches corrected

### Phase 3: Split Screen Tests ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Created tests for SplitManager model and advanced scenarios
2. ✅ Tested tip and tax distribution
3. ✅ Verified per-person totals accuracy
4. ✅ Tested advanced scenarios with shared items
5. ✅ Validated edge cases like removing assigned people
6. ✅ Applied Firebase mocking approach to widget tests

### Phase 4: UI Redesign with Full Confidence
With all core tests now passing, we can proceed with UI redesign with full confidence. The underlying calculation and business logic is thoroughly tested and verified.

### Phase 5: Image Handling Tests (For Offline Caching)
1. ✅ Basic image operations tests are now passing
2. Add specific tests for offline storage behavior
3. Test synchronization when returning online

## How to Use This Guide

Use this document to understand test coverage when planning feature work. Areas with less test coverage will be riskier to change and should be approached more carefully.
