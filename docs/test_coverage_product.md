# Billfie App Test Coverage: Product Guide

## What's This Document?
This guide explains which parts of the Billfie app have automated tests and which parts still need them. Think of tests as safety nets that catch bugs before they reach users.

## Why Testing Matters for Our Current Projects
We're planning two big changes:
1. **UI Redesign**: Making the app look better and more user-friendly
2. **Local Caching**: Allowing the app to work offline and sync later

Without proper tests, these changes could break existing features. Tests help us change the app confidently.

## Test Coverage Status at a Glance

| Feature Area | Coverage | UI Redesign Risk | Offline Caching Risk |
|--------------|----------|------------------|----------------------|
| Receipt CRUD Operations | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low |
| Image Upload & Display | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low |
| Receipt Review & Item Editing | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low |
| Navigation Between Steps | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low |
| People Assignment Screen | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low |
| Bill Splitting Calculations | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low |
| Split Step Screen | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low |
| Summary Step Screen | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low |
| Cloud Functions | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low |
| Image Storage & Retrieval | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low |
| Connectivity Detection | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low |
| Offline Data Storage | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low |
| Dialog Components | 🟢 High | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low |

**Legend:**
- 🟢 Good shape - low risk
- 🟡 Some concerns - medium risk
- 🔴 Needs attention - high risk

## Current Test Status (Product View)

### ✅ Already Well-Tested

**Basic App Functions**
- Creating, updating, and deleting receipts in the database
- Uploading receipt images 
- Reviewing and editing receipt items
- Moving between workflow steps (navigation)
- Bill splitting calculations (including tax and tip distribution)
- People assignment screen (fixed and now well-tested)
- Split screen calculations and functionality
- Summary screen calculations and display

**Backend Operations**
- All cloud functions (image processing, receipt parsing, etc.)
- Data models and how they're stored
- Firebase Storage operations (image uploading and deletion)

**Offline Functionality**
- Network connectivity detection for automatic offline mode
- Local storage of receipt data when offline
- Synchronization preparation for when connection returns

**Component Testing**
- Dialog components (confirmation, error, loading)
- UI element interactions with robust key-based finding
- UI component responsiveness to state changes

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Complete Firebase Testing Improvements ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Implemented a simplified testing approach for Firebase dependencies
2. ✅ Made AssignStepWidget tests fully operational
3. ✅ Applied the same approach to SplitStepWidget tests

### Phase 2: Assignment Screen Tests ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Tests have been written and fixed
- ✅ Firebase initialization issues resolved
- ✅ Return type mismatches corrected

### Phase 3: Split Screen Tests ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Created tests for SplitManager model and advanced scenarios
2. ✅ Tested tip and tax distribution
3. ✅ Verified per-person totals accuracy
4. ✅ Tested advanced scenarios with shared items
5. ✅ Validated edge cases like removing assigned people
6. ✅ Applied Firebase mocking approach to widget tests

### Phase 4: Summary Screen Tests ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Added tests for final summary screen calculations
2. ✅ Verified total calculations including tax and tip
3. ✅ Tested display of per-person information 
4. ✅ Added ValueKeys for robust element finding
5. ✅ Implemented helper methods for improved testability

### Phase 5: Dialog Component Tests ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Added tests for confirmation dialogs
2. ✅ Tested error dialogs and message displays
3. ✅ Implemented loading dialog tests with animation handling
4. ✅ Fixed timeout issues with continuous animations

### Phase 6: Offline Behavior Tests ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Added connectivity_plus package to detect network status
2. ✅ Created ConnectivityService with robust testing
3. ✅ Implemented OfflineStorageService for local data persistence
4. ✅ Added tests for online/offline transitions
5. ✅ Set up foundations for data synchronization when back online

### Phase 7: UI Redesign with Full Confidence ✅ READY
With all tests now passing, we can proceed with UI redesign with full confidence. The underlying calculation and business logic is thoroughly tested and verified.

### Phase 8: Offline Caching Implementation ✅ READY
With the offline testing framework in place, we can now implement the full offline caching solution with confidence:
1. ✅ Basic connectivity detection is implemented and tested
2. ✅ Offline storage is implemented and tested
3. Implement UI indicators for offline mode
4. Implement background synchronization when coming back online

## How to Use This Guide

Use this document to understand test coverage when planning feature work. The app is now fully covered by tests for both UI redesign and offline caching implementation. Proceed with confidence on both projects.
