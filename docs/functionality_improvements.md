# Functionality Improvements

## Overview

This document tracks functionality issues and improvements needed in the app. These are separate from UI redesign concerns and focus on making the app more reliable, intuitive, and functional.

## Critical Issues

### Navigation Issues

1. **Workflow Completion Navigation**
   - **Issue**: When completing a workflow in the summary view, the app doesn't reliably navigate back to the receipt list
   - **Status**: Fixed in recent PR but needs testing
   - **Test Coverage**: Added in `workflow_navigation_test.dart`

2. **Screen Transitions**
   - **Issue**: Some transitions between screens can be jarring or inconsistent
   - **Improvement**: Standardize navigation patterns and transitions

### Data Persistence & Integrity

1. **Form State Preservation**
   - **Issue**: Data can be lost when navigating between workflow steps
   - **Improvement**: Ensure all user inputs are properly saved in the workflow state
   - **Test Coverage**: Needs tests for each workflow step to verify data persistence

2. **Shared Items Calculation**
   - **Issue**: The blue total pill in person cards incorrectly included shared items
   - **Status**: Fixed, with test added in `person_card_test.dart`
   - **Additional Needs**: Review all other displays of person totals for consistency

3. **Receipt Draft Saving**
   - **Issue**: Occasionally drafts aren't saved properly when the app is closed
   - **Improvement**: Implement more robust auto-saving with background persistence

### Error Handling

1. **Network Errors**
   - **Issue**: Poor user feedback during network failures
   - **Improvement**: Add retry mechanisms and clear error messages
   - **Test Coverage**: Need tests simulating network failures

2. **Image Processing Failures**
   - **Issue**: When image processing fails, the error state is unclear
   - **Improvement**: Add better error handling and fallback to manual entry
   - **Test Coverage**: Need tests for image processing error states

3. **Form Validation**
   - **Issue**: Incomplete validation of user inputs in various forms
   - **Improvement**: Add comprehensive validation with clear error messages
   - **Test Coverage**: Need tests for form validation in all relevant screens

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Performance**
   - **Issue**: The app can be slow during image processing and database operations
   - **Improvement**: Optimize image processing and database queries
   - **Measurement**: Add performance benchmarks to CI/CD pipeline

2. **Multi-Receipt Management**
   - **Issue**: Managing multiple receipts with overlapping people is cumbersome
   - **Improvement**: Add batch operations and better people management
   - **Test Coverage**: Need tests for multi-receipt scenarios

3. **Offline Support**
   - **Issue**: App functionality is limited without internet connection
   - **Improvement**: Enhance offline capabilities with local storage
   - **Test Coverage**: Need tests for offline scenarios

4. **Data Export**
   - **Issue**: No way to export receipt data for external use
   - **Improvement**: Add CSV/PDF export functionality
   - **Test Coverage**: Need tests for export feature

## Platform-Specific Issues

1. **iOS-specific**
   - **Issue**: Some UI elements don't conform to iOS design guidelines
   - **Improvement**: Better adapt UI for iOS platform
   - **Test Coverage**: Need platform-specific UI tests

2. **Android-specific**
   - **Issue**: Back button behavior inconsistent on Android
   - **Improvement**: Standardize back button behavior
   - **Test Coverage**: Need Android-specific navigation tests

## Technical Debt

1. **Provider Management**
   - **Issue**: Provider setup is becoming complex with nested providers
   - **Improvement**: Refactor provider structure for better maintainability
   - **Test Coverage**: Need tests for provider state management

2. **Code Organization**
   - **Issue**: Some files are becoming too large and have mixed responsibilities
   - **Improvement**: Break down large files into smaller, focused components
   - **Test Coverage**: Ensure test coverage is maintained during refactoring

3. **Test Coverage Gaps**
   - **Issue**: Inconsistent test coverage across features
   - **Improvement**: Expand test coverage to reach at least 80% coverage
   - **Measurement**: Set up coverage reporting in CI/CD

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Critical Path Fixes**
   - Navigation after workflow completion
   - Data persistence between workflow steps

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Network error handling
   - Form validation

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Image processing speed
   - Database query optimization

4. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Offline support
   - Data export options

## Conclusion

Addressing these functionality issues will significantly improve the reliability and usability of the app, regardless of UI design changes. Each improvement should be accompanied by appropriate tests to ensure the functionality works correctly and continues to work through future changes.
