## Implementation Steps

- **Refactor Widget Tests for Robustness:**
  - Before undertaking major UI redesigns, update existing widget tests to use `GlobalKey` or `ValueKey` for locating critical interactive elements (like navigation buttons).
  - Replace current finders (e.g., `find.text`, `find.byType`, `find.ancestor`) with `find.byKey` where appropriate.
  - Ensure all tests pass with key-based finders before proceeding with visual redesigns. This will make the tests less brittle and less likely to break due to structural or stylistic changes in the UI that don't affect functionality.
