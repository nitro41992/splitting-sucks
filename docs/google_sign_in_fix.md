# Google Sign-In Fix Documentation

## Problem

The app experienced two issues:

1. Version conflicts between:
   - GoogleUtilities 7.x (used by Firebase)
   - GoogleUtilities 8.x (required by GoogleSignIn)

2. iOS deployment target mismatch:
   - FirebaseStorage requires iOS 16.0 minimum
   - App was targeting older iOS versions

## Solution

### 1. Unified Authentication Approach

We've implemented a unified approach using Firebase Auth's `signInWithProvider` method for both iOS and Android platforms, eliminating the need for the GoogleSignIn plugin.

#### Key Changes

1. Removed the `google_sign_in` plugin dependency from pubspec.yaml
2. Updated `AuthService` to use Firebase Auth's `signInWithProvider` for both platforms
3. Created a clean-up script to reset project dependencies

#### Why This Works

- Firebase Auth's `signInWithProvider` method directly interfaces with Google's authentication system
- This approach bypasses the need for GoogleSignIn plugin, avoiding the version conflict
- Creates a consistent authentication flow across all platforms

### 2. iOS Deployment Target Update

We've updated the iOS deployment target to match Firebase requirements:

1. Set iOS minimum version to 16.0 in AppFrameworkInfo.plist
2. Updated Xcode project settings to use iOS 16.0
3. Created a script to apply these changes easily

## How to Apply the Fixes

### Fix Google Sign-In:

```bash
./scripts/fix_google_sign_in.sh
```

### Fix iOS Deployment Target:

```bash
./scripts/fix_ios_deployment_target.sh
```

These scripts will:
1. Clean the Flutter project and remove cached dependencies
2. Update deployment targets and configuration files
3. Clean and rebuild iOS/Android platform files

## Testing

1. Run the app on iOS and verify Google Sign-In works
2. Run the app on Android and verify Google Sign-In works
3. Verify user data is correctly retrieved after authentication

## Future Considerations

1. Keep Firebase dependencies updated
2. Monitor Firebase release notes for any changes to authentication methods
3. Consider implementing other authentication methods (Apple Sign-In, Email) for backup
