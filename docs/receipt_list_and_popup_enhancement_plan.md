# Receipt List & Popup Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Modern Design Trends (2025) Principles for Billfie

Billfie will follow the latest 2025 UX/UI trends, focusing on:
- **Minimalism:** Clean layouts, ample white space, and clear hierarchy. Avoid visual clutter and unnecessary decoration. [Source: Medium - UX/UI Trends 2025](https://medium.com/codeart-mk/ux-ui-trends-2025-818ea752c9f7)
- **Playful-Professional Tone:** Friendly, approachable elements (rounded corners, soft colors, subtle icons) balanced with a professional, trustworthy feel. [Source: UX Trends 2025](https://trends.uxdesign.cc/)
- **Clarity & Accessibility:** Prioritize legibility, intuitive navigation, and clear feedback. Use high-contrast text and simple iconography.
- **Material You/Material 3:** Leverage modern Material Design principles for consistency and familiarity. [Source: material.io](https://m3.material.io/)

No advanced AI-driven UI, dark mode, or AI-generated avatars are planned at this stage. The design will use user-uploaded or default avatars and a minimal, modern icon style.

## Bugs / UX Issues / Notes (2025-06-09)

- **Popup Design:**
  - [x] The popup/modal for receipt details looks clunky and crowded. Needs more white space, better alignment, and clearer visual hierarchy.
  - [x] The editable restaurant name field is not intuitiveâ€”it's unclear how to confirm/save changes. There is no clear feedback when the name is updated.
  - [x] The edit icon is always visible, but there is no clear 'save' or 'done' action after editing the name. Consider a more standard edit/save flow or auto-save with feedback.
  - [x] The status pill and close button are too close to the restaurant name; spacing and grouping should be improved.

- **People/Attendees Display:**
  - [x] The list items don't properly show the people/attendees in the main receipt list.
  - [x] In the popup, the people section is empty even for completed receipts. This needs to properly show all attendees.
  - [x] There's no indication when no people are assigned to a receipt.
  - [x] People should be displayed in a more visually appealing way with avatars or icons.

- **Receipt Status Issues:**
  - [x] Some receipts appear to be completed (have summary data) but still show up in "Drafts".
  - [x] Need to implement automatic detection and update of receipt status based on data presence.
  - [x] Add a startup scan to fix any existing receipts with incorrect status.

- **Responsive Updates:**
  - [x] Restaurant name updates don't always reflect in the UI immediately.
  - [x] Need clearer feedback when data is successfully saved.

- **Visual Hierarchy:**
  - [x] More consistent spacing and padding throughout the receipt cards and popup.
  - [x] Better use of colors to differentiate between draft and completed receipts.
  - [x] Empty states need better styling and clearer messaging.

---

## 1. Editable Restaurant Name in Popup
- [x] Add an editable text field for the restaurant name in the receipt popup/modal, styled minimally
- [x] Add an edit icon or make the name tappable to trigger editing (use playful, clear iconography)
- [x] Save and update the restaurant name in the data model and UI
- [x] Ensure updates reflect in the main receipts list and all relevant views
- [x] Validate and sanitize input

---

## 2. Receipts List: Remove Useless Attributes & Actions
- [x] Remove the three-dot menu from each receipt card if no actions are available
- [x] Remove the "Pending" status and $0.00 if not meaningful
- [x] Only display useful attributes: restaurant name, date, people, and status
- [x] Ensure the card layout is minimal, clear, and visually balanced

---

## 3. Date Format Consistency
- [x] Change all date displays to mm/dd/yyyy format
- [x] Update date formatting logic in both list and popup

---

## 4. Show Restaurant Name & Attendees
- [x] Display restaurant name prominently on each receipt card (bold, clear, minimal)
- [x] Show a row of attendee avatars or names (distinct people, minimal style)
- [x] If attendees > 3, show "+N" for overflow

---

## 5. Draft Completion Logic
- [x] If the summary view has data (items assigned, people exist), auto-mark draft as complete
- [x] Remove the "Complete" button; only show "Exit" or "Back"
- [x] Optionally, show a confirmation when draft is auto-completed

---

## 6. Status Pill Consistency
- [x] Use the same pill style (color, shape, font) for status in both list and popup (minimal, playful-professional)
- [x] Use title case ("Draft", "Completed") for status text

---

## 7. Additional Redesigns
- [x] Redesign receipt card layout for clarity and modern look (minimal, playful-professional)
- [x] Redesign popup/modal for Material 3 style, rounded corners, and spacing
- [x] Ensure accessibility (labels, focus, contrast)
- [x] Add confirmation dialog for "Delete Receipt"
- [x] Use shared widgets for pills and avatars

---

## 8. Security & Validation
- [x] Sanitize all user input (restaurant names, etc.)
- [x] Ensure only authorized users can edit/delete receipts

---

## 9. QA & Testing
- [x] Add/Update tests for new UI and logic
- [x] Verify all enhancements work as intended

---

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Each section above should be checked off as completed
- [x] PRs should reference checklist items
- [x] Product can review this doc to track implementation status
