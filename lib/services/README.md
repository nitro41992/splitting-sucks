# Authentication Security Enhancements

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the auth_service.dart file.

## Implemented Security Measures

### Rate Limiting
- Tracks failed login attempts per email address
- Limits number of consecutive failed attempts before requiring additional verification
- Implements temporary account lockout after too many failed attempts

### CAPTCHA Integration (Framework Only)
- The code includes hooks for CAPTCHA integration
- CAPTCHA would be required after 3 failed login attempts
- Currently implemented as a placeholder with debugging output

### Account Lockout
- Temporary account lockout for 15 minutes after 5 failed login attempts
- Prevents brute force attacks by limiting attempt frequency

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Detailed error messages without leaking sensitive information
- Proper handling of various Firebase Auth exception types
- Consistent error response format

## Best Practices

### Future Security Enhancements
1. Implement a proper CAPTCHA solution (e.g., reCAPTCHA)
2. Add biometric authentication support (fingerprint, face ID)
3. Implement multi-factor authentication
4. Add IP-based rate limiting for additional protection
5. Consider implementing a server-side rate limiting solution for stronger security

### Data Storage
- Login attempt data is stored locally using SharedPreferences
- For a production app, consider server-side tracking for more robust security

### Note for Developers
When implementing the actual CAPTCHA solution, replace the `_checkLoginAttempts` method's placeholder with an actual CAPTCHA verification.
